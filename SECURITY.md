## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously and appreciate your efforts to 
responsibly disclose your findings. If you believe you have found a security 
vulnerability in our project, please report it to us as soon as possible.

To report a vulnerability, please open a pull request with the following information:

* A brief description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
* Potential impact of the vulnerability
* Any additional information that may be helpful

Once we receive your pull request, we will investigate it as soon as possible. 
We will keep you informed about the status of your report and provide regular updates 
as we work to resolve the issue.

If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work with you to determine the appropriate remediation action and provide credit for your discovery. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation for our decision.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and users safe.
